####Credits & Thanks
This is based on bw-w's CoffeScript plugin: <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">https://github.com/bm-w/CoffeeScript.mode</a>. 
Before that it was a fork of Sean Durham's Coda/SubEthaEdit syntax coloring mode for the
CoffeeScript language, revisited for use with Coda 2.
